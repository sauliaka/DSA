# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how bubble sort works:
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/embed/bubblesortAV

- Bubble sort for each pass compares each number to next one and swaps bigger one to the right, until it's in the final position, then loops again.

## Task 2

- Refer to the following link. Your task is to show the behavior for one iteration of the outer for loop of Bubble Sort (Try at least 3 cases).
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Exercises/Sorting/BubsortPRO.html

- Done

## Task 3

- The following snippet is from `./src/bubble.cpp` lines 16-28. Discuss in groups how the code works:

```cpp

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        for (j = i + 1; j < 10; j++)
        {
            if (a[j] < a[i])
            {
                temp = a[i];
                a[i] = a[j];
                a[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        pass++;
    }
```

- This is bubble sort algorithm for numbers 0-10 and it stores value in temp while doing swapping

- The following snippet is from `./src/selection.cpp` lines 34-41. Discuss in groups how the code works:

```cpp
    for (j = i + 1; j < 10; j++)
    {
        if (myarray[j] < ele_small)
        {
            ele_small = myarray[j];
            position = j;
        }
    }
```

- As the name itself suggests, the selection sort technique first selects the smallest element in the array and swaps it with the first element in the array.

Next, it swaps the second smallest element in the array with the second element and so on. Thus for every pass, the smallest element in the array is selected and put in its proper position until the entire array is sorted.

This is reversed bubble sort

## Task 4: Individual, at home

- Discuss the complexity analysis of selection sort. Refer to the link below:
  https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/selection-sort/

- The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), n = number of elements in the array.
