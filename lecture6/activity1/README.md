# Activities

## Task 1: Tree Definition

- Answer at least 5 questions from the following link. Make sure you write the question as well as the answer.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Exercises/Binary/DefSumm.html

  What is the minimum number of internal nodes in a binary tree with 8 nodes? - 4

  What is the minimum number of nodes in a full binary tree with height 3? - 7

  True statement - None of the above

  False statement - Every binary tree has at least one node

  Suppose T is a binary tree with 14 nodes. What is the minimum possible height of T? - 3
